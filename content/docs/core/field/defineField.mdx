description: Define fields in the form

Fields are the basic building blocks of forms, containing information such as name and validators. A field can be expressed as an input box, select box, radio button, or even a Modal, etc., components with complex expressions.

## Regular Fields
- Use `defineField` to define a field. The `Field` object contains information such as the field's name, type, description, etc.

```ts
import { defineField } from '@signals-form/core'

const username = defineField({
  // ...
})
```

## Array Fields
- Use `defineArrayField` to define an array field. The `ArrayField` object contains information such as the field's name, type, description, etc.

```ts
import { defineArrayField } from '@signals-form/core'

const hobbies = defineArrayField({
  // ...
})
```

## Layout Fields
- Use `defineVoidField` to define a layout field. The `VoidField` object contains information such as the field's name, type, description, etc. Layout fields are typically used for layout components, such as cards, dividers, etc.

```ts
import { defineVoidField } from '@signals-form/core'

const loginCard = defineVoidField({
  // ...
})
```


## Types
When using `defineField`, it has two generics:
- The first generic represents the type of the field value. It can be `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, etc.
- The second generic represents the type of the field's Props. Defaults to `Record<string, any>`.

```ts
import { defineField } from '@signals-form/core'
import Input from './components/Input'

interface InputProps {
  label: string
  placeholder: string
}

const username = defineField<string, InputProps>({
  id: "username",
  component: Input,
  props: {
    label: 'Username',
    placeholder: 'Please enter username'
  }
})
```
