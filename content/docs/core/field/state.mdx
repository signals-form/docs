## Overview
- Field states are divided into two types: field value state and field metadata state.

## Handler Object
- `handler` provides a series of methods to operate field states, including getting current values, updating values, setting error messages, etc.

## Handler States

### Value States
- `value`: The value of the field
- `props`: The properties of the field
- `messages`: The error messages of the field

### Metadata States
#### Lifecycle State
- `isHidden`: Whether the field is hidden
- `isDisabled`: Whether the field is disabled
- `isValidating`: The validation state of the field
- `isValid`: Whether the field value is valid
- `isInitialized`: Whether the field has been initialized
- `isMounted`: Whether the field has been mounted
- `isDestroyed`: Whether the field has been destroyed

#### Field Meta State
- `isPristine`: Whether the field is in its initial state
- `isTouched`: Whether the field has been touched
- `isDirty`: Whether the field has been modified, even if restored to default value
- `isBlurred`: Whether the field has lost focus
